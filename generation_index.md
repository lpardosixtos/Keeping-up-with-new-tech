## Text-to-image 

Generative models are interesting and fun, you will never get the same reaction from your friends by showing you 99% accurate classifier, now try telling them that you can generate images from text descriptions and they will lose their minds. I got the chance to experiment with text-to-image genreators while searching for my Masters thesis topic. Follow these posts to know what I learnt on this journey.
