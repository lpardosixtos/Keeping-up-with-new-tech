## Welcome to our study blog!

We are a group of friends that want to keep learning new technologies and their related theory. Each of us has been enthusiastic about research before, this is our effort to keep up with new tech that may or may not be related to our 9 to 5 jobs.

We will add content as we have time to do it. Feel free to open issues and share your thoughts so we can all learn together.

While we happen to be mainly interested in Statistics, Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. We want to have a wide range on topics on this site.

1. [Natural Language Processing.](nlp_index.md)
2. [Text-to-Image Generation.](generation_index.md)
3. [Statistics.](statistics_index.md)

We understand that frameworks and programming languages are key to developing new technology. And we want to share with you tips and bits of knowledge that we have collected. Do you think some of these can be better? Open an issue and tell us how! there is always room for improvement.
