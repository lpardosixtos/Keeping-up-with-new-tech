## Welcome to our study blog!

We are a group of friends that want to keep learning new technologies and their related theory. Each of us has been enthusiastic about research before, this is our effor to keep up with new tech that may or may be related to our 9 to 5 jobs. 

We will add content as we have time to do it. Feel free to open issues and share your thoughts so we can all learn together.

While we happen to be mainly interested in Statistics, Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
